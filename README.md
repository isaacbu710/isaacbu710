## Hello, I'm Edgar Isaac Hern√°ndez Burgos, a Junior Data Analyst with a scientific background and a deep motivation for solving problems through data. With a solid foundation as a Food Chemist and a Master's degree in Quality Systems Engineering from UNAM, I've found data analysis to be a powerful way to optimize processes, generate value, and make evidence-based decisions.
